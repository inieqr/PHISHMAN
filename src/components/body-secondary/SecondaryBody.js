          Phishing is a type of online scam where criminals impersonate
          legitimate organizations via email, text message, advertisement or
          other means in order to steal sensitive information. This is usually
          done by including a link that will appear to take you to the company’s
          website to fill in your information – but the website is a clever fake
          and the information you provide goes straight to the crooks behind the
          scam. To detect the malicious websites in the most efficient way, we
          use a Machine Learning method called Artificial Neural Network which
          was trained on a dataset of 600,000 legitimate and malicious URLs.
